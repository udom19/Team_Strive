# Team_Strive
Team Strive Sign-up/Sign-in App is a very basic web application that allows registered users to login to their unique dashboards using their email and password. First-time users are required to first create an account by filling and submitting the sign-up form.

For the technologies used, the use of frameworks would be an overkill given the the size and scope of the project.

On the front end, HTML took care of mark up and structure, while layout and styling were handled by pure CSS.

On the back end, Node Js prevailed. A simple authentication was implemented to protect certain routes, like the dashboard. This is to ensure that only registered users get access to these routes,

The app is fully deployed on Heroku and can be accessed through the link https://team-strive.herokuapp.com/
